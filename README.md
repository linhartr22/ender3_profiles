# ender3_profiles
This is my collection of Ender 3 3D Printer Profiles. These are still a work in progress but I'm getting really good results with these.

Ender3_RDL_My_Normal.curaprofile is my primary profile. I use it and sometimes adjust the infill but that's about it.
Ender3_RDL_My_Normal_TW.curaprofile was based on Ender3_RDL_My_Normal.curaprofile with 1.2mm wall thickness yielding 3 wall thickness. I believe you get better strength increasing the number of walls. The only time I increase infill is if I'm having issues with top skins. There may be changes made in Normal that didn't make their way into Normal_TW.
